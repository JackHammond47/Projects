      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this website to learn the basics of getting started with the popular tabletop role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons. There is a overflowing amount of information available online and often when a person asks someone they know about trying it out, that nerd gets way too excited about getting to share about one of his/her favorite hobbies and overwhelms that person with information, which leads to a loss of interest. My website will be an answer to that problem as well as helping people who don’t know where else to go. I plan on making a homepage showing encouraging messages about how to get started playing and my 2 child pages will be on what resources you need to get started and how to find other people to play with. There are other sites that explain this but are also loaded with, in my opinion, way too much information for someone just getting started. My site will stand out as a very simple guide on the world’s biggest roleplaying game.

      <h3>What You Need</h3>
      <p>
        “From the beginning of DnD, all you needed was a pencil, paper, dice, and some rules. Nowadays we are very fortunate to have the internet and you only need a single device like a laptop or phone to get started. It may sound overwhelming but the core requirements are the same. You will need a page for your character, some virtual dice, and a copy of the rulebook. That’s it. Your group will also need one Dungeon Master, or DM to run the game for you. That person doesn’t play the game as a character, they control all the monsters, people, and the world your group will play in.”
Character Sheet- “This sheet is a single page that you record everything about the person you are playing as. (Show image of character sheet). It might look like a lot of information, but it really is just your equipment like armor and weapons, your character’s race (like human or elf), and their skills and abilities (like how strong or smart your character is). You can fill all this out yourself by reading the rules or you can use an online tool such as D&D Beyond to build it for you (recommended for new players).

Dice- “In Dungeons and Dragons you play with 7 different dice, called because of how many sides are each dice. They are a d4, d6(the normal dice), d8, d10, d12, d20, and a d100 (which is just another 10 sided die for 10-100). You can roll dice online, although once you start getting more serious it is more fun to roll actual dice which you can buy a set of for $6 on amazon.

Rulebook- “There is only book you need to start playing- the DnD Player’s Handbook (5th Edition or 5e). This book retails for around $50, but don’t worry! That is only for people who like having high-quality, hardbound, books in person. The actual content of the book is available online for free. In fact the link below contains the full pdf!
Link to 5e player’s handbook pdf 
Dungeon Master- “Lastly there will be one person who has a bigger responsibility to lead everyone else on an epic adventure. This person also needs dice and the players handbook, but they will also need a few more things. When it comes to adventures, you can run (or play) a campaign (another word for a full adventure) that is pre-built or make your own (called homebrew). Pre-built campaigns are available for purchase as well as a few free ones you can find online. Homebrew campaigns are much more difficult as you have to build a world, a story, people, towns, and monsters all for your characters. There are resources to help with this like the 5e monster manual, a guide to monsters and their stats, as well as the Dungeon Master’s Guide 5e, a book on how to be a DM. Regardless of the path you choose, it is the most hardworking role so the person you group decides to be the DM should have experience playing or at least watch videos on how to run your first game.
Additional Resources- This will list other things you can have like a DM screen, music, whiteboards, maps, miniatures, etc.

      <h3>How to Find Group</h3>
      <p>
        This page will have information on how to find a group to play with. There will be information on subreddits such as r/lfg (looking for group), facebook groups, and ways to ask around. With DnD’s rise in popularity much more people are playing and so if you ask around enough, you can find people to start playing with. Also information on player etiquette and what to do when conflicts arise.
