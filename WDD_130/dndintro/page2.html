            <h2 class="sub_heading">What Do You Need to Start?</h2>
            <h4 class="sub_heading_text">
                From the beginning of DnD, all you needed was a pencil, paper, dice, and some rules. 
                Nowadays we are very fortunate to have the internet and you only need a single device like a laptop or phone to get started. 
                It may sound overwhelming but the core requirements are the same. 
                You will need a page for your character, some virtual dice, and a copy of the rulebook. 
                That’s it. Your group will also need one Dungeon Master, or DM to run the game for you. 
                That person doesn’t play the game as a character, they control all the monsters, people, and the world your group will play in.

            <h3 class="sub_heading">Character Sheet</h3>
            <h4 class="sub_heading_text">
                This sheet is a single page that you record everything about the person you are playing as.  
                It might look like a lot of information, but it really is just your equipment like armor and weapons, your character’s race (like human or elf), and their skills and abilities (like how strong or smart your character is). 
                You can fill all this out yourself by reading the rules or you can use an online tool such as D&D Beyond to build it for you (recommended for new players).

            <h3 class="sub_heading">Dice</h3>
            <h4 class="sub_heading_text">
                In Dungeons and Dragons you play with 7 different dice, called because of how many sides are each dice. 
                They are a d4, d6(the normal dice), d8, d10, d12, d20, and a d100 (which is just another 10 sided die for 10-100). 
                You can roll dice online, although once you start getting more serious it is more fun to roll actual dice which you can buy a set of for $6 on amazon.

            <h4 class="sub_heading_text">
                There is only book you need to start playing- the DnD Player’s Handbook (5th Edition or 5e). 
                This book retails for around $50, but don’t worry! 
                That is only for people who like having high-quality, hardbound, books in person. 
                The actual content of the book is available online for free. 
                In fact, the link below contains the full pdf!

            <h4 class="sub_heading_text">
                Lastly there will be one person who has a bigger responsibility to lead everyone else on an epic adventure. 
                This person also needs dice and the players handbook, but they will also need a few more things. 
                When it comes to adventures, you can run (or play) a campaign (another word for a full adventure) that is pre-built or make your own (called homebrew). 
                Pre-built campaigns are available for purchase as well as a few free ones you can find online (or on the links below). 
                Homebrew campaigns are much more difficult as you have to build a world, a story, people, towns, and monsters all for your characters. 
                There are resources to help with this like the 5e monster manual, a guide to monsters and their stats, as well as the Dungeon Master’s Guide 5e, a book on how to be a DM. 
                Regardless of the path you choose, it is the most hardworking role so the person you group decides to be the DM should have experience playing or at least watch videos on how to run your first game.

                Now you might be thinking, there has to be more than that. 
                And you’d be right! 
                Above is the minimum you need to get started (and other people of course). 
                However, there are things you can slowly add to have a better experience if you like. 
                These things include, but are not limited to: playing music in the background, having whiteboards, using miniatures, home-made or storebought maps, a screen for the DM to hide behind, etc.
